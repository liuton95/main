Hi, welcome to my page!

I'm a PhD student in the [https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/ ECE department] at [https://www.northwestern.edu/ Northwestern University], supervised by [http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/ Prof. Qi Zhu]. My research interests include optimization, control and learning theories as well as applications on connected and automated vehicle and cyber-physical systems.

Prior to Northwestern, I received my B.S. from department of control science and engineering from [https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/ Zhejiang University]. I also visited the [https://cee.engin.umich.edu/ Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering] at [https://umich.edu/ University of Michigan, Ann Arbor] and was pleased to work with [https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/neda-masoud/ Prof. Neda Masoud].
